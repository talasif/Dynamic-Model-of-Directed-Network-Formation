Files, code and appendices of seminar project of network formation


Shared files contains 3 folders: Body, Code & Output

	Body - contains the paper and the online appendix

	Code - contains 3 files:
		1. one_way_flow_model.py the		- main python code for the simulations we made
		2. one_way_flow_model_payoffs.py	- python code for calculating comulative payoffs
		3. p_optimal_graphs_final.m 		- matlab code to preduce the plot for the paper
		
	Output - contains 2 folders
	
		1. Compare tables - contains Excel tables which compare Bala and Goyal's simulations to the replication we made 
		   and a table which compares Dynamic and Static simulations.
		2. Payoffs - contains an Eexcel table with comulative payoffs of empty and random initial networks and 
		   t tests & an F test, respectively.
